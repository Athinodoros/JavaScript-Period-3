Create :

to create a document in a collection you can use the simple insertOne() command :

db.author.insertOne({name:"Athinodoros" ,lName : "Sgouromallis"});

this command will add me in the author collection. But if we had an array of documents
we could use the insert() command :

db.author.insertOne([{name:"Athinodoros" ,lName : "Sgouromallis"},{name:"YourName" ,lName : "YourLastName"}]);
this command would add both you and me.

Read :

to read documents from our collection we use the find command:

db.author.find();
this would return the whole list of documents in the authors collection.
db.author.findOne();
this will return the first document in the authors collection.

we could also expand our demands like this :

db.author.find({name:"Athinodoros"});
this will return all the documents where the name equals to Athinodoros.

There are tones of operators that help you point to a specific document but I'm not going to describe all of them here :)
More info can be obtained here:   https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-operations-introduction/

Update :

Updating a document is also easy and can be done like this:

db.collection.updateOne(
  {name: "Athinodoros"},
   {name: "Nos"},
   {
     upsert: true,
     writeConcern: {name:"someOne"}
   }
)
this command will find the entry with my name as the value for the name field and replace it with Nos
BUT if I do not exist in the collection it will create one because I specified the upsert to be true.

We can also use the set the $set operator to set new fields in a document like this:


db.inventory.updateOne(
      { "name" : "Athinodoros" },
      { $set: { "languages" : ["Greek","JavaScript","Java","English"] } }
   );

This will find the first document matching the name Athinodoros and add the field languages resulting the document to have 3 fields
the name the lName and an array which is the languages.

Remove:

db.authors.remove(
   {name:Athinodoros},
   {justOne:true}
);

this will find the first entry with my name and delete it. If we didn't specify the justOne as true it would delete all
 documents with name set to Athinodoros.
