MongoDB is Document-oriented

Instead of taking a business subject and breaking it up into multiple relational structures, MongoDB can store
the business subject in the minimal number of documents. For example, instead of storing title and author
information in two distinct relational structures, title, author, and other title-related information can
all be stored in a single document called Book.


Redis as described in redis.io

Redis is high performance keu-value and data structure store that can be treated as memory.
Any look-up has a big O notation of (n) and that makes it extremely fast as it indexes the hashed
values of the key.

We could think of Redis and other key-value databases as a HashMap.
