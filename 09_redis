Redis is an extremely fast database that stores key-value sets.

That enables us to store the session on redis and fire up multiple instances of our server with a balancer that will distribute
the incoming requests to the various instances. The problem is that if there is client with a session that the server needs to
access information about the user for example there is now guaranty that the balancer will allocate the same user to the
same server instance. So a smart move would be to store the session in an external database so that any server can go and fetch
the session from there, and redis is a very good choice to do that.
