NoSql databases are in general not sql databases...

NoSql databases are called all those databases that don't use queries to access data and they don't follow the same
guidelines as the traditional relational databases which follow specific rules about schema-table standards.

NoSql databases are divided to three categories (for now) :

1) key-value store
2) Document (Mongo is a documents Database)
3) Graph databases



Data Model      	        |   Performance|Scalability|Flexibility|Complexity|Functionality
Keyâ€“Value    Store 	        |    high	       high	       high	       none	    variable (none)
Column-Oriented Store	    |    high           high	 moderate	   low        minimal
Document-Oriented Store	    |    high         variable     high	       low	    variable (low)
Graph Database	            |    variable	  variable	   high	       high	    graph theory
Relational Database	        |    variable	  variable	   low	     moderate	relational algebra


The table above explains in a very low-level the main differences among the various Databases.
